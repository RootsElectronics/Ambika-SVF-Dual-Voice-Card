# Ambika-SVF-Dual-Voice-Card
Adaptation of the Mutable Instruments Ambika SVF Voice Card in 0603 SMD, with 2 Voices per voice card


My initial prototype (verified working at 02/2021) utilised the original through hole zener diodes. On this version I have simply changed those for a surface mount equivalent. 



Will upload BOM soon, but for now:




There are a few of these out in the wild now, someone kindly noted a fix for calibration they were having on 2 out of their 3 voice cards.
To quote
"I swapped R10 and R32 to 36k and they all calibrated approximately in the middle of the range (it may be worth experimenting with the feedback cap as well I guess.... but I'm not going to !)"
