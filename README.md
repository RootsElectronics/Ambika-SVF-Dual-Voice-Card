# Ambika-SVF-Dual-Voice-Card
Adaptation of the Mutable Instruments Ambika SVF Voice Card in 0603 SMD, with 2 Voices per voice card


My initial prototype (verified working at 02/2021) utilised the original through hole resistors. On this version I have simply changed those for a surface mount equivalent. 



Will upload BOM soon, but for now:

Only place the following resistors <b>AFTER</B> programming both Atmega328 (or do not place on pick n place)

R54 (MISO)
R55 (SCK)
R53 (MOSI)
